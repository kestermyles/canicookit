        number: 3,
        title: 'Add the Cheese',
        content: 'Aim for 3-5 different cheeses with varying textures and flavors: a soft cheese (brie or goat cheese), a hard cheese (aged cheddar or parmesan), a blue cheese, and something mild (mozzarella or havarti). Cut some into slices and leave others whole for guests to cut themselves. Scatter cheese cubes for easy grabbing.',

        title: 'Add Fresh and Dried Fruit',

        title: 'Deglaze the Pan',
