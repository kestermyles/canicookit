# Tilapia Coconut Curry with Tamarind

This is the kind of curry that makes people think you spent all day on it. You didn't. The sauce takes about 25 minutes to build, the fish goes in at the end and is done in under 10.

Tamarind is what makes this different — it adds a fruity sourness that balances the richness of the coconut milk. Find it in any Asian or Indian grocery, or the world foods aisle. It keeps in the fridge for months.

## What you need

- 1kg tilapia fillets, cut into large chunks
- 4 tbsp coconut oil
- 2 tsp mustard seeds
- 1 tsp fenugreek seeds (optional)
- 2 tsp kaffir lime powder or 6 kaffir lime leaves torn
- 2 onions, finely chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2-inch piece of ginger, grated
- 2 tsp turmeric
- 4 tsp chilli powder (start with 2 if unsure)
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 4 tomatoes, roughly chopped
- 1 tsp tamarind paste
- 400ml full-fat coconut milk
- Salt
- Juice of 1 lime
- Fresh coriander to serve

## How to make it

**1. Prep the fish**
Pat dry with kitchen paper. Season with salt and a pinch of turmeric. Set aside.

**2. Temper the spices**
Heat coconut oil in a wide deep pan over medium-high heat. Add mustard seeds and put a lid on — they'll start popping within 30 seconds. Once popping slows, take the lid off. Add fenugreek seeds if using, stir for 10 seconds.

**3. Build the base**
Add onions and cook for about 10 minutes until deep golden. Don't rush this. Add garlic and ginger, cook 2 more minutes. Add all the ground spices and stir for 30–60 seconds until toasty.

**4. Add tomatoes**
Add chopped tomatoes and cook for 5–7 minutes until completely broken down and the oil starts to separate back out at the edges.

**5. Add tamarind and coconut milk**
Stir in tamarind paste and cook for 1–2 minutes. Pour in coconut milk, bring to a gentle simmer, cook for 5 minutes. Taste and adjust salt.

**6. Cook the fish**
Gently nestle fish chunks into the sauce. Don't stir — spoon the sauce over the top instead. Simmer uncovered for 6–8 minutes until fish is opaque all the way through and flakes easily.

**7. Finish**
Squeeze lime juice over. Scatter fresh coriander. Taste one more time.

## Serve with
Steamed basmati or jasmine rice. Warm naan. Cucumber raita alongside.

## Good to know
- The sauce (without fish) keeps for 3 days — reheat and add fresh fish when needed
- Cod, haddock, monkfish or prawns all work in place of tilapia
- Full-fat coconut milk only — reduced fat splits
- The tamarind is what makes this different. Don't leave it out.
