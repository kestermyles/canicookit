# Sourdough Crumpets

If you've got a sourdough starter — active or discard — this is one of the best things you can do with it. Proper crumpets, the kind that toast up golden and hold a puddle of melted butter in every hole. Not the pale, rubbery things from a plastic bag. These.

**What is sourdough discard?** Every time you feed a sourdough starter, you pour some of it away first — that's the discard. Most people bin it. This is a much better idea.

## What you need

- 750g sourdough starter (100% hydration — equal weight flour and water — active or discard both work)
- 3 tsp sugar
- 3 tsp baking powder
- ¾ tsp fine salt
- 3–6 tbsp water (only if needed to loosen)
- Butter or oil for greasing
- Crumpet rings (or large round cookie cutters)

**Optional, for extra bubbles:**
- ⅜ tsp bicarbonate of soda

## How to make it

**1. Make the batter**
Tip the starter into a large bowl. Add the sugar and salt and stir them in. Sprinkle the baking powder (and bicarb if using) over the surface — don't stir yet, just let it sit for 30 seconds. Then stir it through. The batter will immediately start to puff up and look airy. Cook it while it's still lively.

Check the consistency. It should be thick but spoonable. If it's stiff, add water one tablespoon at a time.

**2. Set up your pan**
Place a non-stick or cast iron pan over medium-low heat. Let it warm up for about 3 minutes. Grease lightly with butter. Grease the inside of your crumpet rings thoroughly — really get into the edges or the crumpets will stick. Place the rings in the pan and let them heat up for a minute.

**3. Cook the crumpets**
Spoon batter into each ring until about halfway up the sides.

Leave them completely alone on a low-medium heat for 5–7 minutes. You're waiting for: bubbles rising to the surface and popping, leaving holes that stay open; the top turning from shiny and wet to matte and set; the bottom turning golden.

When the top is fully set, carefully lift the rings off. If you want a lightly browned top, flip for 20–30 seconds only.

**4. Toast and eat**
Split and toast until the cut side is properly golden. Butter immediately and generously. The butter should melt completely into the holes.

## Troubleshooting
- **No holes forming:** Batter too thick, or heat too high
- **Holes closing over:** Heat too high, turn it down
- **Sticking to the rings:** Didn't grease them enough
- **Flat and dense:** Starter wasn't active enough, or batter sat too long

## Good to know
- Makes 18–24 depending on ring size
- Freeze brilliantly — toast straight from frozen
- Works with both active starter and discard
