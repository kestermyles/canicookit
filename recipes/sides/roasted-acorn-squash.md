# Roasted Acorn Squash

Five minutes of prep, the oven does the rest. Caramelised edges, tender sweet flesh, barely any effort. A proper autumn side dish.

**How do I cut it without losing a finger?** Place it on a folded tea towel to stop it rolling. If it feels dangerous, microwave it for 2 minutes first to soften the skin.

## What you need

- 1 acorn squash
- 2 tbsp olive oil or melted butter
- 2 tbsp brown sugar or maple syrup
- 1 tsp cinnamon (optional)
- ½ tsp salt
- ¼ tsp black pepper

## How to make it

**1. Get the oven on**
Heat to 200°C (180°C fan). Line a baking tray with baking paper.

**2. Prepare the squash**
Cut in half from top to bottom. Scoop out the seeds. Slice each half into wedges about 2.5cm thick — roughly 8–10 wedges total.

**3. Season**
Lay wedges on the tray in a single layer. Brush with oil or butter. Sprinkle over salt, pepper, cinnamon, and brown sugar.

**4. Roast**
40–50 minutes, flipping halfway. Done when a fork slides in easily and edges are caramelised and sticky. If tender but not coloured, turn oven up to 220°C for the last 5 minutes.

## Two ways to change it up
- **Savoury:** Skip the sugar. Use garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, olive oil. Finish with tahini and lemon.
- **Make it a meal:** Roast as halves. Fill with quinoa, dried cranberries, toasted pecans and feta.

## Good to know
- Keeps in the fridge for 4 days
- Uncut squash keeps on a shelf for up to a month — no fridge needed
- The seeds are worth keeping — rinse, toss with oil and salt, roast at 180°C for 15 minutes
