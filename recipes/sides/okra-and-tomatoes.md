# Sautéed Okra and Tomatoes

Okra has a reputation problem. This recipe is the antidote. Cook it hot with no liquid first until it browns, then add tomatoes and let everything collapse into a thick, jammy, deeply savoury sauce.

**Where do I find okra?** Most large supermarkets stock it fresh. Buy it firm and bright green.

## What you need

- 450g fresh okra, sliced into 1cm rounds
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 large ripe tomatoes, diced (or 1 x 400g tin diced tomatoes, drained)
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- ½ tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
- Salt and black pepper
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar or lemon juice
- Fresh parsley or spring onions to serve

## How to make it

**1. Prep the okra**
Rinse and pat completely dry. Slice off the tops and cut into 1cm rounds. Dry okra = less slime.

**2. Cook the aromatics**
Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook for 3 minutes until soft. Add garlic, cook 30 seconds.

**3. Brown the okra**
Turn heat to medium-high. Add okra and spread out. Cook for 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it starts to brown at the edges. This is the step that fixes the slime problem.

**4. Add tomatoes and spices**
Stir in tomatoes, paprika, cayenne, salt and pepper. Turn heat to medium and cook for 10–12 minutes until tomatoes break down completely and everything goes thick and jammy.

**5. Finish**
Add vinegar or lemon juice. Taste and adjust seasoning. Scatter fresh herbs over the top.

## Good to know
- Keeps in the fridge for 3 days, improves overnight
- Brilliant base for baked eggs — make two wells, crack in eggs, cover and cook until just set
- Bacon fat instead of olive oil takes this in a more traditional Southern direction
