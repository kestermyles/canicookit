# Garlic Sautéed Rainbow Chard with Yellow Courgette

Rainbow chard is one of those vegetables that looks almost too good to cook. The good news is it tastes as good as it looks, and this is one of the fastest, most satisfying things you can do with it. Twenty minutes, one pan, goes with almost anything.

**What is Swiss chard?** A leafy green related to beetroot and spinach, with thick colourful stems and big dark leaves. The stems and leaves cook at different speeds, which is why you add them separately.

## What you need

- 1 large bunch rainbow or Swiss chard
- 1 medium yellow courgette, sliced into half-moons about 1cm thick
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 small shallot (or ½ onion), finely chopped
- Salt and black pepper
- 1 tsp chilli flakes (optional)
- 1 tbsp lemon juice or sherry vinegar
- 1 tbsp butter (optional)
- Splash of water

## How to make it

**1. Prep the chard**
Pull the leaves away from the stems. Slice the stems into small pieces. Roughly chop the leaves separately. Keep them in two piles — they go in at different times.

**2. Colour the courgette**
Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the courgette with a pinch of salt in a single layer. Cook for 3–4 minutes without moving much until golden underneath. Flip and cook another minute. Tip onto a plate.

**3. Build the flavour base**
Turn heat to medium. Add remaining olive oil, then the garlic and shallot. Cook gently for 1–2 minutes until soft and fragrant. Don't brown the garlic.

**4. Cook the stems**
Add the chard stems. Cook for 3–4 minutes until they start to soften.

**5. Add the leaves**
Add the chopped leaves with a pinch of salt and a splash of water. Stir and cover for 2–3 minutes until wilted.

**6. Bring it together**
Uncover. Add courgette back in. Add chilli flakes, lemon juice, and butter if using. Cook for another minute until glossy. Taste and adjust seasoning.

## Good to know
- Make it fresh and eat it — doesn't keep or reheat brilliantly
- Sherry vinegar instead of lemon gives a deeper, more savoury edge
- Add toasted pine nuts or crumbled feta to make it more of a meal
- Spinach or kale can replace the chard
